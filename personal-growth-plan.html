                            </div>

                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most successful leaders strive for ways to effectively influence their followers to achieve positively deviant performance or “an emphasis on outcomes that dramatically exceed common or expected performance” (Cameron, 2012, p.2). Prior to my participation in the Azusa Pacific masters in leadership program I believed exceptional performance was a natural byproduct of unwavering task pursuit. I placed less importance on the social and personal competencies necessary to generate authentic, leader-follower interaction. Although leaders and followers are closely linked, it is the leader, who often initiates the relationship, creates the communication linkages and carries the burden of maintaining the relationship (Lipman-Blumen, 1996, p.7). Instead, my primarily authoritarian style of leadership placed the responsibility of relationship-management on the follower which could have impacted the overall professional environment.  </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reviewing the individual achieving styles inventory (ASI) with the 360 ASI allowed me to compare and contrast the personal interpretation of achieving styles with the perceptions of my colleagues and superiors. I also examined how various behaviors can indicate strengths and weaknesses within the 5 MAiL program competencies: Strategic mobilizer, change catalyst, inspiring developer, responsible influencer, and principled decision maker. MAiL program evaluations and course content continue to provide an excellent platform for reflection and refined self-awareness. I believe this process is necessary for a leader to recognize the need for deep change. Ultimately, a leader willing to undergo the pain and suffering associated with long-term, irreversible change will be better equipped to motivate and inspire positively deviant performance in others.  </p>
                            <div class='block_heading sectioned'>
                                <h3>ASI and Course Competencies</h3>
                            </div>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I completed the individual ASI about six months ago. At that time, I demonstrated strong direct set styles of leadership by scoring an average of a 5.9/7 for intrinsic, competitive, and power achieving styles. Instrumental and relational achieving styles were far less prevalent in my overall leadership approach and held an average of approximately 4.2/7. The results were not surprising as I embodied many of the characteristics that describe common authoritarian leadership practice of the stage two, geopolitical era. Even so, my strengths correlated well with one Masters in Leadership (MAiL) program competency in particular: Strategic mobilizer. I could efficiently outline a strategy or vision for the future through clear and transparent communication. However, I did not consistently apply the relational or instrumental sets of styles necessary for the development of others in an authentic or virtue-centered manner. More specifically, I was simply less successful demonstrating the leadership traits found within an inspiring developer or responsible influencer. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, I discovered that a shift in approach would be necessary to achieve positively deviant performance in an organizational setting. This outcome would require a well-rounded leadership philosophy balancing the importance of task pursuit and relationship-management. I realized an adaptive leadership approach could be accomplished while maintaining the direct set styles of leadership that remained my strengths. Crucibles enable people to learn life is uncertain, and they have limited control. This new reality empowers individuals to challenge old assumptions and understand they must demonstrate personal agency to deal with their world (George, 2015, p.57). I used past experiences, from predominantly results oriented environments, to mold personal leadership practice. I needed to change the given script or paradigms of the past for my future growth and viability as a leader. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half a year later the process of deep change has already been somewhat successful. Recently, I examined the results of the 360 group ASI and was pleased to see significant increases in instrumental and relational sets of styles. Contributory, collaborative, and entrusting styles, within the connective leadership model, all saw a nearly 1.0+ increase from the individual ASI inventory 6 months earlier. Interestingly, the direct set of styles remained a leadership strength and overall showed a more comprehensive, connective leadership philosophy. These developments are particularly positive because I emphasized the infusion of a servant leadership approach. Application of this approach came naturally as it closely mirrored my own ethical values and moral code. Thus, I was able to establish high quality leader-follower exchanges in an effort to increase trust and empower others to be advocates for the organizational vision.

                                <h3>Future Growth</h3>
                            </div>

                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the leader the imperative is to use a leadership style that best meets the follower’s motivational needs. This is done by choosing behaviors that complement or supplement what is missing in the work setting (Lipman-Blumen, 1996, p.115). Moving forward, I must continue to reflect on the effectiveness of my leadership approach through the lens of my followers. Adaptability is essential for effective leadership practice and a necessary characteristic found within a change catalyst. Personally, I believe demonstrating this MAiL program competency in any environment, even in ambiguous situations, will greatly impact the success rate of a leader. While I’ve learned that success can be measured by more than just results I still find myself focusing too much on the pursuit of task, sometimes to the detriment of my own personal wellness. Recognition of this imbalance is important and I believe a greater understanding of my authentic self, facilitated through MAiL program coursework, will continue to inspire development of personal and social competencies. </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Participation in the MAiL program coincided with a career shift from professional sports to education. This significant change in environment and culture demanded realignment for personal sanity and organizational success. My experiences undergoing the process of change highlight how important internal and external alignment is to the success of a leader in almost any profession. MAiL program competencies combined with Lipman-Blumen’s connective leadership model prescribed a template for leadership effectiveness in a diverse professional landscape growingly interconnected by advances in technology and communication.  </p>
