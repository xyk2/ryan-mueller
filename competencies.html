                                    <p>The strategic mobilizer demonstrates the ability to strategically organize oneself, others and the essential resources towards the achievement of a clearly communicated plan. Leaders who demonstrate instrumental and direct set styles of connective leadership are more likely to embody this competency. Fundamental change does not occur easily. However, strategic mobilizers are equipped to confront the challenges associated with organizational change by designing functional strategies for implementation of their vision. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>Inwardly focused cultures are impacted by low trust, poor teamwork, and poor leadership practice in middle management. Often times, leaders fail to acknowledge how these factors can impact a members’ receptivity to change. </p> 

                                    <blockquote>People who have been through difficult, painful, and not very successful change efforts often end up drawing both pessimistic and angry conclusions. They become suspicious of the motors of those pushing the transformation; they worry that major change is not possible without carnage.
                                        <footer>Kotter, 2012, p. 20</footer></blockquote>
                                    
                                    <p>Strategic mobilizers can combat the negative perceptions associated with change by speaking honestly and persuasively with individuals, small groups, and large groups. Authentic leader-follower interaction will motivate others to become advocates for a strategic mobilizer’s vision which will aid in in cross-divisional communication of the mission.  </p>
                                    
                                    <p>I found Kotter’s outline of the differences between management and leadership to be very helpful when applying the characteristics of a strategic mobilizer. Creating a work environment that encourages creative thinking and innovation requires more than just management skills such as control, problem-solving, and organizing. Instead, strategic mobilizers must establish, align, motivate, and inspire others. These leadership traits require extensive collaboration and a concerted effort to strengthen dyadic linkages. Ultimately, this approach will assist in the implementation of Kotter’s eight step change process and establish a sense of urgency among followers. I’ve applied Kotter’s methodology to change efforts at Taipei American School while observing the environment and follower perceptions. I intend to track our development as a community using Kotter’s methods while continuing to establish strong patterns of communication. </p>

                                    <p>Acquiring the skills of an inspiring developer requires a leader to consistently demonstrate authentic interest in the growth and progression of their followers. A servant leadership approach, one where the leader places their follower’s needs above their own personal interests, seems to describe many of the strengths in this program competency. Effectively handling conflict or problems through respectful communication and appreciation of diverse perspectives is not an easy task and requires a heightened state of self-awareness and emotional restraint from the leader. Prior my involvement in the MAiL program, I would typically demonstrate the characteristics of an authoritarian leader. I believe this philosophy developed through years of athletic participation at the collegiate and professional level. In the sports forum, the pursuit of task is a priority and in the process I neglected to consider the importance of relationship-management.</p>
                                   
                                    <p>The MAiL program has since illuminated the importance of establishing authentic interaction, a skill indicative of an inspiring developer. The mentor-mentee relationship is an excellent way to strengthen dyadic linkages between others while helping to build meaningful alliances in an organizational setting. Zachary (2012) shares a competency model that breaks down the learning cycle of the mentor-mentee relationship. Essentially, there are four stages to this model: Unconscious incompetence, conscious incompetence, conscious competence, and unconsciously competent. Each stage outlines an individual’s level of awareness on “how their beliefs, assumptions, and behaviors affect their daily lives by letting go of self-limiting and unrealistic assumptions that hold them back” (Zachary, 2012, p.12). After critically examining this concept, I realized my leadership approach was much more representative of leaders from the geopolitical era. Ultimately, my leadership confidence had exceeded me own ability.</p>

                                    <p>I’ve been fortunate to undergo a leadership transformation empowering me to apply much of our MAiL program content into personal and professional contexts. The flexibility of the Azusa Pacific University (APU) graduate program includes a robust online platform that allowed me to inject learned material into my current leadership position at Taipei American School (TAS). I will demonstrate my application of knowledge with a few academic and anecdotal artifacts.</p>

                                    <p>
                                    Three years ago I accepted a leadership position at TAS (Director of Health, PE and Sports K-12). This position was new to the organization and put in place on the heels of a significant leadership transition in the athletic department prior to my arrival. Physical education instructors and coaches were understandably leery of new leadership after years of poor communication and ambiguous initiatives. The environment was not ideal for authoritarian leadership practice. Followers needed a leader who demonstrated the skills of an inspiring developer. One who was willing to re-conceptualize mistakes, empower staff, and establish trust. Unfortunately, my ability to maximize interaction and contribute to others tasks was not a strength at the time.</p>
                                   
                                    <blockquote>Power achievers naturally assume they should direct and delegate certain tasks to other people in the chain of command who in turn should carry out their instructions. When they delegate tasks, power achievers see their actions as a legitimate expression of their power, and thus they usually retain overall control and leadership.
                                        <footer>Limpan-Blumen, 1996, p.156</footer>
                                    </blockquote>
                                   

                                    <p>I certainly relished the beauty of a “well-coordinated performance” (Lipman-Blumen, 1996, p.157). However, I neglected to see the negative impact this had on the organizational environment at TAS.</p>
                                   

                                    <p>Lipman-Blumen’s (1996) connective leadership model helped me become consciously competent as I learned the importance of a complete, situational leadership approach. The model outlines leadership into three sets of styles: direct, relational and instrumental. My strengths indicated I was a master of my own tasks with an ability to lead in high-stress, competitive environments. I became aware of my strengths after completing the L-BI ASI and A-ASI leadership evaluation. This evaluation confirmed my perceived strengths while illuminating my need to improve on the instrumental and relational sets of leadership found in Blumen’s connective model.</p>
                                   

                                    <p>I’ve used this model as a foundation for leadership practice and continued growth. Professionally, I’ve installed a number of organizational initiatives designed to rebuild follower trust and increase transparency. I currently meet with faculty once a month in a collaborative forum to openly discuss organizational trends and patterns. In addition, I make quarterly community wide presentations updating faculty, students, and parents with various athletics and wellness initiatives. Authentic interaction and networking has helped to make followers advocates for my overall vision while strengthening delivery of various programs to our students.</p>
                                   

                                    <p>Relationship management and development of staff at all organizational levels will be a continued goal moving forward. Efficient models providing additional performance feedback for both myself and followers will be essential for maximizing our growth individually and collectively. Constructive criticism still occasionally elicits an emotional response. I must work to align my internal and external environments through increased perspective obtained by authentic leader-follower interaction. I should be able to reasonably measure my results in both a quantitative and qualitative fashion. Retaking the A-SI and L-BI ASI evaluations in the coming months may demonstrate my shift towards a more complete connective leadership approach. In addition, continued high quality leader-follower exchanges should improve relationships and provide clear examples of followers supporting the initiatives of my department.</p>

                                    <p>To effectively demonstrate the skills indicating my competency as a change catalyst requires my own receptivity to personal change. A willingness to recognize the need for change, personally or professionally, denotes an individual who displays strong personal competencies, like self-awareness. A self-aware leader is usually adaptable and refuses to shy away from problems that may make them feel uncomfortable. A change catalyst is similar as they demonstrate the capacity to address problems efficiently through the effective assessment of personal and organizational dynamics. 
                                    
                                    <p>A change catalyst should be able to adequately assess the impact cultural dynamics may have on organizational perceptions and leader-follower interaction during times of change. There are various forms of change. Quinn (1996) believes that deep change differs from incremental change in that it requires new ways of thinking and behaving. Certainly, deep change requires a long-term adjustment and potentially significant risks, but a change catalyst is prepared for those risks and successfully manages both the areas that remain stable and those that are changing. Change catalysts’ can reinvent themselves and demonstrate a willingness to suffer the risks associated with bringing about change in others. I believe change catalysts, like an inspiring developer, exhibit varying traits found within a servant leadership approach that allows them to place the interests of their followers above personal needs. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>MAiL program content helped me to understand the personal leadership transition taking place over the last few years. I subconsciously began the process of deep change to stave off the feeling of slow death through pervasiveness and burnout. My personal beliefs were not aligned with the environment surrounding Taipei American School and I subconsciously realized my authoritarian, impersonal approach would not succeed in an educational institution. Quinn (1996) helped elucidate by predicament by stating that one key to successful leadership is personal change. Personal change is a reflection of our inner growth and empowerment. Empowered leaders are the only ones who can induce real change. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>Past successes had etched a given map or paradigm into my psyche that influenced the way I processed information. The MaiL program helped me to realize I must thwart my natural defense mechanisms to confront my philosophical contradictions. This process of self-discovery was not easy. Nonetheless, through my internal realignment, I’m able to more easily embrace change and prescribe its plausibility for others. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>There is an unreal tendency to call high-level administrators “leaders” simply because they are in positions of authority (Quinn, 1996, p. 98). There is a differencing between management and leadership. Instead of inspiring and positively influencing others, my power approach focused on directing and informing followers. I was stuck in Quinn’s (1996) “normal state” where new realms are rarely explored and the status quo is preserved to mitigate personal risk and vulnerability. To enter a more others-focused, externally open mindset I had to suffer the risk associated with full engagement. More specifically, by generating authentic interest in my followers by building strong, consistent communicative patterns. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>At Taipei American School I had to realize many of followers had been through difficult and not very successful change attempts by previous leaders. They were pessimistic and skeptical of a new leader with little educational experience. I realized, instead of planning and organizing I had to establish direction and align others, again highlighting the transition from a management to a leadership approach.</p>
                                   
                                    <p>Kotter provides a unique eight step change process that worked well as an initial prescription for organizational change.  Upon my arrival to TAS, I worked to establish a sense of urgency by meeting with all coaches and teachers under my supervision right away. I was able to learn interesting perspectives through valuable face-to-face interaction. I quickly evaluated which employees would go above and beyond their contractual obligations which helped to create my first guiding coalition. From there, I developed a vision and communicated it clearly to the faculty and community. My vision was favorably received and provided some unexpected short-term gains and incremental change. </p>
                                   
                                    <p>I must continue my development as a change catalyst by consolidating the gains of the last few years and producing more change where needed. Coaching and physical education programs need more oversight and more comprehensive system of evaluation.  To accomplish this goal I plan to hire, promote, and develop those who can efficiently implement the change vision. I do not have complete autonomy at TAS, but the successful implementation of collaborative initiatives and the completion of the MAiL program as a resume builder may bring me closer to that goal. It’s reasonable to surmise this authority could be earned within the next 6-12 months. The goal of organizational autonomy is essential to eventually anchoring new approaches into the TAS culture. However, I do not want to confuse this position with a regression to a power-oriented leadership approach. Decisions that impact the organization are not made without genuinely considering performance feedback from followers and the risks associated with deep change. </p>

                                    <p>Principled decision makers are proficient in identifying and applying ethical principles to decision-making through a balanced approach involving both systemic and intuitive analysis. Similar to the change catalyst competency, leaders who possess characteristics of a principled decision maker (PDM) must demonstrate a strong sense of self. More specifically, these leaders exhibit strong personal and social competencies allowing them to recognize the need for internal realignment. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>Well rounded social and personal competence strengthens a leaders’ emotional intelligence and acts as a catalyst when faced with the daunting task of personal, deep change. To overcome their fears, some leaders drive so hard for results that they lose touch with reality and become incapable of acknowledging their failures or weaknesses (George, 2015, p. 45). PDM’s recognize when personal values fail to align with their external environment. Instead of emphasizing the pursuit of task they model and maintain values of candor and inclusiveness despite external pressures. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>Some of my clearest leadership strengths are found in the direct set of styles within Lipman-Blumen’s connective leadership model; intrinsic, competitive, and power. These styles serve PDM’s well as they must demonstrate the ability to act in decisive, urgent, and committed ways to achieve results. PDM’s must also demonstrate instrumental styles of connective leadership in effort to effectively use themselves and others, ethically, as a means to an end. Lipman-Blumen refers to this approach as principled instrumental action as it allows leaders to create shared responsibility among team members by involving them in critical deliberations and decisions. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>I believe it’s important to mention the role spirituality plays in the development of a PDM. Spirituality, is the sum total of the attitudes and actions that define our life of faith (Chittister, 1990, p. 5). PDM’s embody high standards and ethical acumen in professional and social settings. Their consistency is a strength grounded in their relationship with God. Without this strong foundation members can sense inauthentic behavior from leadership. </p>
                                    
                                    <blockquote>Jesus had looked into the man’s soul and diagnosed the condition of his heart. You see, on the outside he was doing all the right things, but on the inside his heart was divided. His possessions and his position where competing with God for primacy. He has surrendered his outward behavior to God, but his commitment was not absolute. <footer>Stearns, 2014, p. 24</footer></blockquote>
                                    
                                    <p>Leaders who demonstrate the PDM competency refuse the temptations associated with status and power. They may demonstrate direct set styles of leadership that utilize these elements as a method to influence others. However, their interaction is conducted in an ethical and transparent manner. I intend to expand my spiritual horizons by further familiarizing myself with Stearns text and the teachings of the Bible. Hopefully, these action steps with strengthen my spiritual base and positively impact my ability to make ethical decisions despite environmental pressures. </p>

                                    <p>Responsible influencers (RI) must demonstrate the ability to empower others through virtue-centered engagement with people and systems. This process requires genuine care and consideration for the well-being of others. Exhibiting this competency means effectively analyzing the social, political, economic, and cultural factors that affect individuals and organizations. RI’s are advocates for justice and strive to balance power dynamics within organizations to achieve an equitable, inclusive environment that meets the needs of its diverse population. Demanding equality in complex cultures is no easy feat and RI’s will undoubtedly face incredible odds in an effort to preserve human rights and dignity. Ultimately, this process builds upon the resiliency that emerges from the despair associated with injustice and prejudicial behavior. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>Early on, I possessed a natural inclination to take action against exclusionary behaviors aimed towards other human beings. The experiences of my youth provided a number crucible moments that although uncomfortable, helped to establish early characteristics of a RI. Crucibles enable people to learn life is uncertain, and they have limited control. This new reality empowers individuals to challenge old assumptions and understand they must demonstrate personal agency to deal with their world (George, 2015, p.57). I still struggle with idea of limited control and routinely find myself applying unnecessary power in an effort to influence others. I endeavor to reduce the application of power in certain circumstances as it impacts my ability to establish rapport in a professional and social settings. Leaders who demonstrate the RI competency must remain capable of engaging in relevant professional networks while building quality relationships with members. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>A servant leadership approach demonstrates many of the Masters in Leadership program competencies outlined in my portfolio. Servant leaders routinely place the needs of their followers above their interests, sometimes at the expense of personal maintenance. The servant leadership approach requires a strong relational set of styles from the connective leadership model; collaborative, contributory, and vicarious. My personal achieving styles inventory (ASI) reveals the relational set of styles needs further growth and development. Supervisors and colleagues completed the 360 degree ASI and supported this theory by ranking the relational set of styles lower than direct or instrumental sets. I intend to evaluate this constructive feedback and consider alternative ways to build upon this area of the connective leadership model. I believe becoming involved in mentoring opportunities could help establish the strong collaborative relationships necessary to become a consistent RI. </p>
