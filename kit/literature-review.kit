                            </div>

                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal or professional change can be a difficult process full of uncomfortable and painful experiences. Our growingly interconnected and diverse landscape calls for leaders who demonstrate the leadership characteristics necessary to mitigate some of the organizational risks associated with change. A change catalyst should exhibit a well-rounded leadership approach that highlights spiritual and emotional strengths while recognizing perceived weaknesses. This process of self-reflection and awareness is essential for internalizing leadership competencies and eventually applying them to an overall leadership approach.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Masters in Leadership program at Azusa Pacific University highlights five core program competencies essential for leadership development: Change catalyst, principled decision maker, responsible influencer, strategic mobilizer, and inspiring developer. A change catalyst demonstrates the capacity to help organizations pursue positive change. A leader who exemplifies the qualities of a change catalyst should be prepared to assess, diagnose, and solve organizational problems influencing culture and productivity. Change catalysts are passionate and willing to undergo the process of personal transformation and learning. They excel in communicating concepts effectively to diverse groups of people in environments that may not be receptive to change.</p>
                            <br>
                             <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the application of this competency is essential for a connective leadership approach. Our APU program readings support this position while illuminating important change considerations for any prospective or current leader. I will discuss the linkages between the connective leadership model and the change catalyst competency in an effort to intertwine my own perspective on the topic and related literature.</p>

                                <h3>Components of a Change Catalyst</h3>
                            </div>
                            <h4>Spirituality</h4>
                            <div style='padding-left:30px;'>
                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An effective change catalyst should demonstrate ethical leadership principles grounded in their own spirituality. Chittister (1990) says “spirituality is the sum total of the attitudes and actions that define our life of faith.” Establishing a connection with our spirituality helps to define our morale code and purpose in life. This clarity is essential for leaders who must realign internal and external environments for the benefit of an organization or group of people. Chittister’s (1990) “Rule of Benedict” can be used as a guide to strengthen competencies necessary to inspire deep change. </p>
                                <br>
                                <blockquote>
                                    <p>Over and over again, curses and cults and psychological exercises are regularly tried and regularly discarded while people look for something that will make them feel good, steady their perspective and bring meaning and direction to their lives. </p>
                                    <footer>Chittister, 1990, p.2</footer>
                                </blockquote>
                                <br>

                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it’s important to note I perceive the Rule of Benedict as more of a guide than an actual rule. The Rule inspires an authentic understanding of one’s self while providing a sense of direction that can be used throughout life.</p> 
                                
                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chittister (1990) suggests we must set out to live an ordinary life extraordinarily well. Barton (n.d.), from our beatitudes coursework, added this understanding: “Great men suffer hours of depression through introspection and self-doubt. That is why they are great. That is why you will find modesty and humility the characteristics of such men.” Through the suffering associated with personal transformation, humbled leaders are more likely to effectively diagnose the need for deep change in others. </p>
                                
                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christianity is a faith that mirrors much of Chittister’s (1990) guidance on spirituality and connects seamlessly with Stearns (2014) The Hole in our Gospel. The Christian faith was meant to spread across the world and transcend cultural barriers. Christians should not impose their beliefs on others, rather embody the spirit of the gospel so that others can experience God’s love in impactful ways. Similar to the Benedictine rule, Christianity calls for us to remain strong in the face of adversity and temptation. </p>
                                <br>
                                <blockquote>
                                    <p>Then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said: “If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me and for the gospel will save it. What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul?” </p>

                                </blockquote>
                                <br>




                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A leader who demonstrates the competency of a change catalyst must be capable of communicating in an authentic, transparent manner. A leader’s ability to connect followers through high-quality exchanges will undoubtedly be impacted by their understanding of the principles of Christianity. </p>
                               
                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We learn that Christ’s criterion for determining the authenticity of someone’s profession to follow him is whether he or she tangibly cared for others in need (Stearns, 2014, p.48). The concept of caring for those in need can easily be applied to an organizational setting. For example: In a professional environment a change catalyst must demonstrate patience and adaptability when dealing with ambiguous situations. Their willingness to authentically care for their followers will establish trust in the workplace and create a culture receptive change. </p>
                               
                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot overstake the importance of authentic spiritual practice. Phoniness can be recognized by others and quickly destroy initiatives designed to foster organizational change. Manipulation and secretive behavior may be an effective, incremental solution in certain organizational cultures, but ultimately the leader’s deceptiveness will be illuminated. Perhaps a leader who communicates in this fashion calls themselves spiritually grounded or a Christian, but that description is not entirely accurate. </p>
                               
                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus had looked into the man’s soul and diagnosed the condition of his heart. You see, on the outside he was doing all the right things, but on this inside his heart was divided. His possessions and his position where competing with God for primacy. He had surrendered his outward behavior to God, but his commitment was not absolute (Stearns, 2014, p.24). </p>
                               
                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aforementioned example, outlined by Stearn, occurs commonly in organizations where the pursuit of task is considered more important than our personal maintenance. Throughout our lifetime we occasionally find ourselves at a crossroads or experience something that leaves us questioning our core values and principles. Stearns (2014) calls these “crucible moments”. These are moments that help to define our values and influence our ability to diagnose and prescribe change both internally and externally. </p>
                                <br>
                            </div>

                            <h4>Emotional Intelligence</h4>
                            <div style='padding-left:30px;'>
                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To effectively process crucible moments, socially or professionally, leaders should display attributes of emotional intelligence. Greaves (2009) believes there are four skills that together make up emotional intelligence: Self-awareness, self-management, social awareness and relationship management. Self-awareness and self-management are personal competencies that impact a leader’s ability to recognize internal strengths and weaknesses. Social awareness and relationship management are social competencies that impact leader-follower interaction. Greaves (2009) believes that self-awareness is a foundational skill that makes the other EQ skills much easier to use.</p>
                                
                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without EQ, a leader is susceptible to emotional reactions in stressful or ambiguous situations. Inappropriate communication may stymie organizational growth and make the prospect of deep change less likely. Tucker & Winston (2011) provide a great example of emotional intelligence through mercy:</p>

                                <br>
                                <blockquote>
                                    <p>Mercy commands that the leader first examine the heart of the employee. The leader must consider whether the employee saw an action as wrong, or if perhaps the employee was unaware of the consequences of the behavior. If the employee confesses the wrong action and shows repentance, then the leader ought to show mercy in his judgment. Why? Because the focus of the correction is correction, not vengeance. </p>
                                </blockquote>
                                <br>

                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete EQ allows a leader to process information effectively before responding to a situation. The exercise is different for each of us and may occur instantly or during self-reflection. </p>
                                
                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep change can be a byproduct of reflective behavior. However, deep change differs from incremental change in that it requires new ways of thinking and behaving (Quinn, 1996, p.3).  Leaders must demonstrate the emotional intelligence necessary to recognize the need for change. One key to successful leadership is personal change. Personal change is a reflection of our inner growth and empowerment. Empowered leaders are the only ones who can induce real change (Quinn, 1996, p. 34-35). In order to bring about change in others, catalysts must reinvent themselves. The pain and suffering experienced during this process provides the perspective necessary to facilitate change in others. </p>
                                
                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quinn (1996) routinely uses the term “slow death” to define the stagnation or psychological death of a leader. Stagnation can be a result of complacency or perhaps of lack of connection with others. Self is a point of view that unifies the flow of experience into a coherent narrative. A narrative striving to connect with other narratives and become richer (Quinn, 1996, p. 42). A change catalyst demonstrates the capacity to communicate frequently and openly with others. Without a greater understanding of one’s self: strengths, weaknesses, emotional triggers, morals etc. we lose the ability to connect with others and establish the strong dyadic relationships necessary to inspire deep change and prevent a slow death. </p>
                                
                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The degree to which past successes have etched a given map, script, paradigm, or myth into our brain affects how we process information (Quinn, 1996, p. 65). Leaders capable of change must confront their own cowardice and contradictory behavior. However, recognizing our hypocrisies cannot be accomplished without the personal competency necessary to diagnose internal realignment. Change catalysts must weigh the risk and reward associated with the pursuit of task. Often times we face a choice: task or maintenance. For most of us, under pressure, the pursuit of task drives any thought of maintenance, doing the right is driven out by the need to be busy (Quinn, 1996, p. 60). Maintaining personal wellness, while balancing professional obligations, often requires leaders to realign themselves with their surrounding environment.</p>

                                <h3>Connective Leadership Approach</h3>
                            </div>

                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leadership is a process whereby an individual influences a group of individuals to achieve a common goal (Northouse, 2016, p. 6). Leaders who indicate an understanding of the change catalyst competency are capable of leveraging their influence to attain organizational goals and inspire others to more effectively embrace change. Northouse (2016) believes leadership qualities exist through formal and informal positions in an organization. More specifically, a leader can exert influence from a formal or appointed positon. Alternatively, leaders may also develop organically based on group preferences, regardless of title. Occasionally, leaders in formal positions, fail to earn the trust of their followers. Even so, they continue to influence others through direct and indirect forms of communication. Northouse (2016) believes the aforementioned situation closely resembles management instead of leadership and as a result makes an important distinction. Leadership requires adaptability, change, and movement while management supports order and consistency within organizations. A change catalyst will be required to demonstrate both leadership and management techniques during their tenure. This flexibility requires utilization of the entire connect leadership model. </p>
                            
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last few decades, leadership practice has undergone a shift from the authoritarian principles of the geopolitical era to the transformational leadership techniques prevalent in the connective era. An era where physical and political boundaries no longer prevent us from moving into other spaces. The geographical gap is further shortened by our burgeoning technological advances that continue to expand our capacity to communicate. In the connective era leaders cannot just issue orders, instead, they have to join forces, persuade, and negotiate to solve conflicts (Lipman-Blumen, 1996, p. 20). </p>
                            
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change catalyst competency requires leaders to demonstrate adaptability and innovative capability when solving problems and assessing the need for change. An authoritarian leader who primarily utilizes the direct set of styles found in Lipman-Blumen’s (1996) connective leadership model will be incapable of mastering the change competency. The ability to outperform, take charge, and excel are important styles in the connective leadership model. However, leaning too heavily on this direct set form of leadership ignores the positive impact the instrumental and relational set of styles can have on inspiring deep change. Effective leaders, in the stage three era, should demonstrate relational, instrumental and direct set styles of leadership. Naturally, certain sets of styles will be more easily applied to leadership practice and leader-follower interaction depending on an individual’s experiences and objectives. </p>
                            
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned earlier, the prospect of deep change in any environment, usually involves some level of discomfort and carnage. In order to inspire Cameron’s (2012) positively deviant performance, or an emphasis on outcomes that dramatically exceed common or expected performance, connective leaders must refrain from the temptations associated with incremental change. Connective leaders need to commit themselves steadfastly to the long-term, even when the envisioned future unsettles the short-term arrangements of particular community members (Lipman-Blumen, 1996, p. 21). This approach aligns well with our MAiL program competency, especially through the lens of change catalyst. The process hints at the importance of patience and a willingness to glean perspective from others in an effort to initiate intelligent risks that will foster innovative approaches. </p>
