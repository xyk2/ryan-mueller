                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pursuit of happiness is a flawed generalization commonly shared among people in a growingly diverse, interconnected world. Happiness without meaning represents a relatively selfish existence void of a willingness to overcome obstacles and contribute to the greater good of mankind. Happiness is a byproduct of purpose, essential for identifying our own genuine interests.  The Azusa Pacific University Masters in Leadership Program helped to illuminate my purpose and in the process established a stronger understanding of my authentic self. Self is a point of view that unifies the flow of experience into a coherent narrative- a narrative striving to connect with other narratives and become richer (Quinn, 1996, p.42).</p>

                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northouse (2016) believes that “leadership is a process whereby an individual influences a group of individuals to achieve a common goal.” Transformative leaders must demonstrate an adaptive leadership approach utilizing the Connective Leadership Model to effectively influence others. Adaptive leaders should be willing to endure the pain and suffering associated with deep, personal change. Deep change is different from incremental change in that it requires new ways of thinking and behaving (Quinn, 1996, p. 3).  Leaders who demonstrate the personal competency necessary to recognize the need for change will be better equipped to authentically realign their internal and external environments for continued development. </p>

                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must use ourselves and others ethically as a means to an end. Lipman-Blumen calls this approach “denatured machiavellianism” or principled instrumental action and it’s a theory I apply into my own leadership practice. Transparency indicates genuine care and consideration for others despite the organizational stressors that could negatively impact interaction.  For most of us, under pressure, the pursuit of task drives any thoughts of maintenance, doing the right is driven out by the need to be busy (Quinn, 1996, p.60).  External stress is not a sufficient excuse for an unethical or manipulative leadership approach. A predominantly authoritarian style of leadership is no longer effective leadership practice in the connective era. </p>
