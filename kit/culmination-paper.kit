                            </div>

                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leadership is a process whereby an individual influences a group of individuals to achieve a common goal (Northouse, 2016, p. 6). Prior to my involvement in the Azusa Pacific University (APU) Masters in Leadership program (MAiL) I believed primarily in competitive and power styles of leadership. I subconsciously placed the responsibility of leader-follower interaction on others. Although leaders and followers are closely linked, it is the leader who often initiates the relationship, creates the communication linkages and carries the burden of maintaining the relationship (Northouse, 2016, p. 7). My focus remained on the pursuit of task and rarely considered the value of relationship-management in a professional environment. As a result, members would complete duties, but rarely exhibited positively deviant performance or an emphasis on outcomes that dramatically exceed common or expected performance (Cameron, 2012, p.2). The MAiL program helped me to recognize that personal and social competencies needed further growth and development to become an effective connective leader. Recognizing relational deficiencies required reflection and improved self-awareness. This emotional skill acted as a catalyst for the process of deep change and changed the trajectory of my leadership journey.

                                <h3>Connective Leadership</h3>
                            </div>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ve referenced Lipman-Blumen’s Connective Leadership Model numerous times throughout my leadership portfolio as it helped me to understand that “in this connected world, leaders who repertoires are limited to the more traditional behavior of dominating, competing, or collaborating will be left behind (Lipman-Blumen, 1996, p. 7). The model outlines three sets of leadership styles; direct, relational, and instrumental. Each set provides three styles that illustrate the strengths of that set. For example, intrinsic (excels), competitive (outperforms), and power (takes charge) are the three styles found within the direct set of connective leader. The individual Achieving Styles Inventory (ASI) illustrated direct styles of leadership were a personal strength and relational and instrumental sets needed further development. In the connective era, leaders cannot just issue orders; instead, they have to join forces, persuade, and negotiate to slow conflicts (Lipman-Blumen, 1996, p.20). My predominantly authoritarian approach to leadership was fixed on accomplishing short-term goals at the expense of long-term solutions. Connective leaders need to commit themselves steadfastly to the long term, even the envisioned future unsettles the short-term arrangements of particular community members (Lipman-Blumen, 1996, p. 21). Long-term viability as a leader requires strong dyadic linkages and interaction that empowers others to become advocates for a leader’s vision. To create this kind entrusting and contributory environment I would first have to undergo significant personal change. </p>

                                <h3>Deep Change</h3>
                            </div>

                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring deep change, people have to “suffer” the risks. And to bring about deep change in others, people to have to reinvent themselves (Quinn, 1996, p.11). Reinventing my leadership approach would require new behaviors and habits. I had a choice, either adapt or take the road to a slow death. Traveling down the path of complacency would not have endured me to my new staff. After all, the transition from professional sports to education was a significant external factor that influenced my desire for realignment. I began to realize the process of deep change was different from incremental change as it required new patterns of thinking and behaving. Past successes had etched a given map or paradigm into my psyche that influenced the way I processed information. The MAiL program helped me to realize I must thwart my natural defense mechanisms to confront my philosophical contradictions. This process of self-discovery was not easy. Nonetheless, through my internal realignment, I was able to more easily embrace change and prescribe its plausibility for others.</p>

                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I became more familiar with my own authentic self I was able to turn attention towards my organization. My recent employment dramatically shifted the institutions organizational structure in an effort to reduce the effects of departmental turnover and volatility. </p>

                            <blockquote>People who have been through difficult, painful, and not very successful change efforts often end up drawing both pessimistic and angry conclusions. They become suspicious of the motives of those pushing the transformation; they worry that major change is not possible without carnage. <footer>Kotter, 2012, p. 20</footer>

                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found myself in a precarious positon and immediately gravitated towards the Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument (OCAI) in an effort to diagnose the current and preferred culture of my staff. The OCAI is based on the Competing Values Framework, a theoretical model that is now the dominant framework in the world for assessing organizational culture (Cameron & Quinn, 2011, p. 35). Results from the OCAI are embedded into the Competing Values Framework which describes four organizational dimensions (cultures); clan (collaborate), adhocracy (create), hierarchy (control), and market (compete). The results from the OCAI helped to illustrate the gap that existed between the current and preferred (future) organizational culture. </p>
                            
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kotter’s eight step change process was then implemented to effectively sequence my change efforts. The combination of valid data from a number of external sources, broad communication of that information inside an organization and a willingness to deal honestly with the feedback will go a long way towards squashing complacency (Kotter, 2012, p. 171).  The first step, establishing a sense of urgency, helped identify and discuss potential pitfalls and major opportunities. We addressed the status quo and eventually began to introduce new practices into the organizational culture. </p>

                                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                            </div>
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chittister (1990) suggests we must set out to live an ordinary life extraordinarily well. Barton (n.d.), from our beatitudes coursework, added this understanding: “Great men suffer hours of depression through introspection and self-doubt. That is why they are great. That is why you will find modesty and humility the characteristics of such men.” Through the suffering associated with personal transformation, humbled leaders are more likely to effectively diagnose the need for deep change in others. </p>
                            
                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MAiL program coincided with a significant personal and professional transformation. Not coincidentally, I embarked on a painful and humbling journey of self-discovery in an effort to realign my internal and external environments. This process is not complete, however I take solace knowing that I’ve strengthened personal and social competencies necessary to be an authentic, connective leader. Perhaps my decision to embark into graduate work was in fact a crucible moment, as it certainly left me to question my own core values and principles.  Even so, the learning opportunities I’ve experienced improved my ability to demonstrate each of the five MAiL program competencies while offering a strong support system necessary for continued personal and professional growth.  </p>
